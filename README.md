# How To use 

User Manual 
In this section I will describe how to install and run this application 
1. First Download and unzip Qt Project file 
2. Then open .pro file using Qt Creator 
3. Give some time to qmake to config this .pro file 
4. Run the application using Qt Creator run. 
This application running process in quite easy because. There in no Database or any 
other 3rd party libraries. 
I tried to make this as deploy .exe file but my qt creator is 6.0.0 â€“ beta and my qt version 
is 5.15.0 because of that I am getting some errors when I try to convert this to .exe 
some errors. 


## How to use 
What users can do is already discussed in Scope section I think when you run this 
application you can do the same as discussed in that section 
Basically, you can use this as a text editing tool with so many other functions. 
Hope you enjoy my applicatio
